          <p class="textcenter">
            Hi, I’m Jesse Maw. I’m a UI designer with a background in music and the arts. My skills as a freelance, self-employed musician have enabled me to build designs that are not only clean and useful, but also unique and enjoyable. I serve user experiences and client visions by being open and flexible. Playing many kinds of music with diverse bands, producing music videos, and performing in high pressure environments has led me to value collaboration, spontaneity, and composure. With over 20 years spent in creative mediums, I have honed my methods to bring quality and clarity to every project.</p><br>


            <p class="textcenter">
            Currently based in MT Airy, NC, my wide-ranging interests include traveling, hiking, cooking, writing, meditation, and biohacking. I love moments of solitude, building relationships, uncovering discoveries and making the complex simple.</p><br>


            <p class="textcenter">
            I am available for remote and freelance design work in addition to working for a company who values integrity and helping users. </p>
